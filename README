ABOUT
=====

LinkedGeoData is a project, which converts OpenStreetMap data to RDF and 
interlinks it with other data sets. This data is provided as Linked Data, 
SPARQL endpoint, and downloadable RDF files.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

The code base itself is only relevant for LinkedGeoData developers and
contributors. Everyone else should use the provided services (Linked Data,
SPARQL, REST interface, LGD Browser).

We are in the progress of migrating code to the project. Until this phase is
completed, the code is likely to not work as expected.
