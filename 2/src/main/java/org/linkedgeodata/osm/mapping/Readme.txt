In the near future, everything that is related to the tag mapping should go
here.

This means the content of following packages should be moved here:
org.linkedgeodata.jtriplify.mapping
org.linkedgeodata.jtriplify.mapping.simple
org.linkedgeodata.jtriplify.mapping.methods (this can probably be completely removed)
